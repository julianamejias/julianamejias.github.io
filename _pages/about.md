I am Juliana Mejía Sepúlveda, a Ph.D. student in Environmental Engineering at the
University of Arizona, working with [Dr. Sylvia Sullivan](https://sylviasullivan.github.io/) My research focuses on
studying the frequency and duration of aerosol extreme events (AEEs) and their
main meteorological regimes over the U.S. Southwest.
